## 0.2.0

### BC Breaks

* The `PointInTime` related properties of the `Event` interface are
  removed. The `DefaultHeadersDecorator` now ensures all events receive
  a `Header::TIME_OF_RECORDING` headers.
* The `AggregateRoot` now keeps track of a version, the `ConstructionBehaviour`
  trait has been updated to reflect this and shows how it's implemented.
  
## 0.1.2

### Added

* The `MessageDispatcherChain` is introduced to be able to chain multiple
  dispatchers together. This allows users to compose a dispatching system
  that combined synchronous and a-synchronous message handling.
  
## 0.1.1

### Added

* The `BaseAggregateRoot` behaviour is now extracted into traits so you can
  choice to implement certain concerns yourself without overriding methods.
